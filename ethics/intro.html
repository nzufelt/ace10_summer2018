    <h2>Ethical Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the term, we will come across multiple issues related to standard ethical issues of the digital world. As we encounter these, we will take time to pause and reflect on these issues. This constitutes a writing component for our course.
    </p>
    <h4>What is expected of you for each Ethical Reflection?</h4>
    <ol class="outer-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Become familiar with the topic:</strong> Your first stop is the posted content for the topic.  Read the articles, listen to the podcasts, watch the videos.  Make sure you understand the issue at hand, who are the major players, and what are their desired outcomes?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do your reseach:</strong> Once you understand the issue, your next job is to find at least one new reference to the topic <em>not</em> listed in the original materials.  That's <em>probably</em> an article or blog post, but it doesn't need to be.  It could be a different podcast, a book, a video&mdash;the type of media is not super important.  The thing that <em>is important</em> is the resource
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add your voice:</strong> Finally, create a short reflection website&mdash;the equivalent of one page&mdash;which quickly summarizes the issue and launches into your own reflection.  You should think of this as being a one-page essay, but styled as a website.  You should link to the website from your portfolio&mdash;think of this like your own personal blog.  You can write about anything related to the topic, but you should be sure to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Include your reference seemlessly.  Summarize its main points, form an opinion of it, and offer criticism as necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include your personal opinion.  I don't need to hear just a paraphrasing of the articles I posted on the issue!  I want you to both care about the topic, and show me why you do.
          </li>
          <li>
            Back up every claim you make.  This could be a reference (just add a link, don't both to worry about a certain kind of bibliographic styling!), or the inclusion of an image or graph, or anything else you think justifies your argument.  Feel free to check with me if you have any concerns that something isn't properly argued!
