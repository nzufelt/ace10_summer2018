      <h2>Project 1: Make your portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, you'll be creating your own personal website, which is meant to be both your home base for everything you create in this course, as well as a useful home page for all of your future work.  What I mean by this is that you could conceivably put this on your college and/or job applications, business cards, whatever.  I want this to be the start of "your brand".
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some things that are required for your website, but they are by no means exhaustive&mdash;feel free to add anything else to make this your own!  These could potentially be links to another page for each, or you may choose to have all their content present on this page.  The choice is yours, but it needs to look clean and clear!  It is <strong>very important</strong> that your website be well-styled and designed: for example pick some good colors and fonts, style links to look nice, include images tactfully and cleanly, and use appropriate white space!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic info:</strong> Name, a links to your GitHub page, any semi-professional social media accounts you would like people to know about, and a short "tagline" about who you are.  For example, mine might say "Instructor in Computer Science, Parent, and Avid Cyclist".  Be creative!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bio:</strong> A short bio about you, and perhaps an explanation of the site that users are on.  I want this to feel authentic&mdash;it shouldn't just be "this is my project 1 submission, Dr Z", but I want you to treat this as your own professional-looking online presence, something that you would be proud to show off to any of your grandmother, Mr. Palfrey, your congressperson, and/or your best friend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Projects:</strong> Contains a link to an individual page for each of your personal projects.  This includes, but is definitely not limited to the projects in our course!  Feel free to add anything else you're interested in sharing&mdash;such as your writing samples from other classes or beyond, some art or photos you created, or anything else you're proud of.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ethical Reflections:</strong> This section <em>should</em> actually be links, because you'll need to create individual pages for each reflection.  See the <a href="../ethics/intro.html">Ethical Reflection description</a> for more information.  <strong>Additionally:</strong> A part of this first project is actually to complete your <a href="../ethics/ethics1.html">first Ethical Reflection</a> for our course.  This helps to ensure you have multiple pages to build and design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other:</strong> <em>(optional)</em> An area to include anything that you would think isn't "project worthy", perhaps a more silly bio about your family's 16 dogs, or a letter you wrote to a company when you were 7.  This can catch everything else that doesn't make sense above!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="outro">Good luck, and ask me lots of questions!  Preferably on <a href="https://ace10cs2018.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a>.<span>ðŸ˜€</span></p>
