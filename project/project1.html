  <h2>Project 1: Make your portfolio</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, you'll be creating your own personal website, which is meant to be both your home base for everything you create in this course, as well as a useful home page for all of your future work.  What I mean by this is that you could conceivably put this on your college and/or job applications, business cards, whatever.  I want this to be the start of "your brand".
  </p>
  <p>
     Here are some things that are required for your website, but they are by no means exhaustive&mdash;feel free to add anything else to make this your own!

    <li>
      <strong>First Ethical Reflections:</strong> A part of this first project is actually to complete your <a href="/ethics/ethics1.html">first Ethical Reflection</a> for our course.  This helps to ensure you have multiple pages to build and design.
