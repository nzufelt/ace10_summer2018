    <h2>Project 4: Choose your Adventure</h2>
    <p>
      With this project you have a few options. This project is meant to be a chance to more deeply explore the side of the class you enjoyed the most.
    </p>

    <h3>Continue your app</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      One option available to you is to continue working on the app you built for Project 2. If you’re taking this option, you’ll need to speak with me about what might be an acceptable, interesting new feature for you to add.
    </p>

    <h3>Build another app</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Maybe you have a new idea for a different app that isn’t a continuation of your old one. That’s great! It’s awesome practice to keep trying new things—this was the original plan of Project 4.
    </p>

    <h3>Redesign our course website</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Some people seemed excited by the idea of creating a style sheet for our class, hosted on the real version of our website, so that other students could live-switch to your style sheet. Now’s your chance to make it happen! Carefully style the website using an external stylesheet, and double check that it works on all the site’s different pages. How do you do that? The best way is to "clone" the <a href="https://github.com/nzufelt/ace10_summer2018">repository</a> using GitHub Desktop. Then, you can mess with it locally on your computer. Ask me for help on getting started.
